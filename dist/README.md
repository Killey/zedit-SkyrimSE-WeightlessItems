# zedit-SkyrimSE-WeightlessItems
Forked from zedit-example-patcher: https://github.com/z-edit/zedit-example-patcher

This script is intended to set the weight of certain items to 0.

This script should use a load order generated from a modified version of the xEdit RAB Smash Splitter script: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24321?tab=description
(I'll be creating this load order generator later - will get zedit script working first)
